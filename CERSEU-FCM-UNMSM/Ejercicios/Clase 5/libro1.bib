 abstract = {Kwieciński has proved a geometric criterion for flatness: A morphism f: X→ Y of germs of analytic spaces is not flat if and only if its i-fold fibre power f<sup>{i}</sup>: X<sup>{i}</sup>→ Y has a vertical component, for some i. We show how to bound i using Hironaka's local flattener: If f is not flat, then f<sup>{d}</sup> has a vertical component, where d is the minimal number of generators of the ideal in O<sub>Y</sub> of the flattener of X.},
