 abstract = {Here we investigate topological stability in the space of holomorphic foliations on a compact manifold. We show that under certain conditions near by holomorphic foliations are topologically equivalent. We then present examples of foliations which are stable as holomorphic foliations but unstable as smooth foliations.},

We also give a cohomological criterion for the rigidity of holomorphic foliations induced by group actions and prove the existence of rigid codimension one foliations of degree n - 1 on ${\rm{P}}^n $ for every n ≥ 3.},

 abstract = {There is a well-known rigidity theorem of Y. Ilyashenko for (singular) holomorphic foliations in CP2 and also the extension given by $G\acute{o}mez-Mont$ and $Ort\acute{i}z-Bobadilla$ (1989). Here we present a different generalization of the result of Ilyashenko: some cohomological and (generic) dynamical conditions on a foliation F on a fibred complex surface imply the d-rigidity of F, i.e. any topologically trivial deformation of FT is also analytically trivial. We particularize this result to the case of ruled surfaces. In this context, the foliations not verifying the cohomological hypothesis above were completely classified in an earlier work by X. $G\acute{o}mez-Mont$ (1989). Hence we obtain a (generic) characterization of non-d-rigid foliations in ruled surfaces. We point out that the widest class of them are Riccati foliations.},

 abstract = {In this paper we consider the problem of uniformization of the leaves of a holomorphic foliation by curves in a complex manifold M. We consider the following problems: 1. When is the uniformization function <tex-math>$\lambda_g$</tex-math>, with respect to some metric g, continuous? It is known that the metric <tex-math>$\frac{g}{4\lambda_{g}}$</tex-math> induces the Poincaré metric on the leaves. 2. When is the metric <tex-math>$\frac{g}{4\lambda_{g}}$</tex-math> complete? We extend the concept of ultra-hyperbolic metric, introduced by Ahlfors in 1938, for singular foliations by curves, and we prove that if there exists a complete ultra-hyperbolic metric g, then <tex-math>$\lambda_g$</tex-math> is continuous and <tex-math>$\frac{g}{4\lambda_{g}}$</tex-math> is complete. In some local cases we construct such metrics, including the saddle-node (Theorem 1) and singularities given by vector fields with the first non-zero jet isolated (Theorem 2). We also give an example where for any metric g, <tex-math>$\frac{g}{4\lambda_{g}}$</tex-math> is not complete (<tex-math>$\S 3.2$</tex-math>).},
