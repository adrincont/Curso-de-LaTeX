\begin{document}
If the \psframebox[shadow=true,blur=true]{\Lcs{psframebox}} is used in normal
text with the \texttt{blur=true} option, the result is usually bad because \TeX{}
doesn't take into account that, because of the shadow, the line spacing needs to be
larger for this line. The result with a \psshadowbox[blur=true]{\Lcs{psshadowbox}}
using the option \texttt{blur=true} is a bit different, although it is still not
satisfactory -- it adjusts for the \texttt{shadowsize} but not for the
\texttt{blurradius}. \psblurbox{\Lcs{psblurbox}} on the other hand takes care of
the line spacing. However, for this command you can't change the shadow angle of
\texttt{shadowangle=45}.
