CELIA: Herein I see thou lov'st me not with the full weight that I
  love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father, had banished thy
  uncle, the Duke my father, so thou hadst been still with me,
  I could have taught my love to take thy father for mine; so
  wouldst thou, if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously
  temper'd as mine is to thee.\\
ROSALIND: Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to
  rejoice in yours.\\
CELIA: You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is like to
  have; and, truly, when he dies thou shalt be his heir; for what
  he hath taken away from thy father perforce, I will render thee
  again in affection. By mine honour, I will; and when I break that
  oath, let me turn monster; therefore, my sweet Rose, my dear
  Rose, be merry.\\
ROSALIND: From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports.
  Let me see; what think you of falling in love?
