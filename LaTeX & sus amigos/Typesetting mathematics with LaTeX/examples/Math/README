The files in this directoty are all the examples 
from the book "Mathematiksatz mit LaTeX", 
which is available at Lehmanns online bookstore 
http://www.lob.de (ISBN 978-3-86541-485-4).
Members of DANTE, the german TeX Users Group,
write to office@dante.de and ask for the special 
offer.

All examples are full working documents, which 
needs one of the special test class files, also 
part of this directory. You can also use another
documentclass, but then you have to delete the 
following two lines:
\StartShownPreambleCommands
\StopShownPreambleCommands
