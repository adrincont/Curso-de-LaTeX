To run these example you need the also present example
document classes. ALternatively you can edit the files:

- change documentclass to article or report
- delete the lines 
  -- \StartShownPreambleCommands
  -- \StopShownPreambleCommands

Some minor examples, which uses non free available math fonts,
like Palatino or Helvetica will not work, if you do not have
these fonts installed on your local TeX system.
