## R+knitr+LaTeX workshop: (tentatively) Saturday post-talks
Lab notebooks with LaTeX, R and knitr, led by Boris Veytsman. Zip archive of workshop files.

The work of a research scientist involves keeping daily notebooks. Such a working notebook is a document with text, equations, calculations, figures, tables, code snippets which reflects the current state of the lab research. This workshop teaches how to maintain such notebooks in a TeX/R environment.
